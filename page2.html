<p>Hobby means oneâ€™s favourite occupation. Gardening is my favourite hobby.  i have a garden in front of my reading room. whenever i get time, i work in it. i loose the soil with the spade and weed out the grass. I water the plants regularly. I also put a fence around my garden so that cattle or naughty children can not do any harm to my garden. In the morning my heart leaps up with joy  to see my garden full of various flowers. They spread  a sweet smell. The garden also looks very charming. I also grow various kinds of vegetables in one corner of my garden. The beauty and sweet smell of different flowers make me jolly. On holidays I work more in my garden.

When my friends come to our home, I take them into my garden and show them various flowers. They become very glad to see my garden and thank me. It has improved my body and mind. Before making this garden I was a boy of ill health. I did not feel hungry. I lost my taste for food. Day by day I became weak. I started the garden to have a sound health and my health, in fact, improved. Everyday I work in the garden at least for two hours. As a result of it my blood runs well.</p>
